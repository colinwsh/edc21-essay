            ### Large technology companies and their misrepresentation of the capabilities of their platforms to solve issues in education

            #### Colin Walsh

            -----
            
            It is my view that the large technology companies such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft are focused primarily on the consumer and with this their technology is not designed for the needs of education and their platforms do not operate in the manner they are advertised. As a result of this the adoption of their tools into education is ethically challenging as the goals of these companies is (shareholder value) to increase revenue, usage, and gather large swathes of information about users to improve their algorithms and ultimately sell advertising based on this data. It is within the ethos of these companies to continually innovate and improve their technology, focusing on the individual consumer but this runs in direct opposition to what education has been up until recently which is stable, classroom and community based. As a result of the differing views of technology companies compared to those within the education sector be it teachers, students, or schools, it is difficult to determine if each student is receiving a suitable education and being supported in a correct manner by these new platforms. I believe it is now a perfect time to investigate thoroughly the shift to online education due to the COVID pandemic and if this is a form that provides all the necessary tools and support to students and teachers to succeed and what it is, we as a society want that to be. With the loss of the community of a classroom the attempts to build an online community seems to largely have failed, parents, schools and the government are admitting that remote education is not the same when they struggle to accept the results given by teachers for exams that have not been taken. Ofsted also released their 2020/21 Annual Report which put an emphasis on going back to face-to-face education. Whatever the piece is that makes in person education better eludes online currently. While these tools provide aspects of a classroom, the community and group aspect of being physically in the same location is something that online education lacks.
